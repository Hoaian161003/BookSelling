This is a project to create a highly optimized book-selling website by eliminating unnecessary elements and features while incorporating essential ones. 
Furthermore, we have observed that some websites, despite their purpose of selling books, lack user-friendly interfaces, causing dissatisfaction for book buyers. 
Therefore, for us, making efforts to create a user-friendly interface is a crucial step.
